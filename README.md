# Topomap Generation Code
Example code for loading builder's level recorded data. Generating verification images, creating a resultant topomap and contour surface. As well expected fill material quantity is calculated and provided.

This code should run on any Python 3, with matplotlib 3.1.1 and a similar vintage numpy.

A discussion of the impetus and how the code works can be found at [clayb.net/blog/generating-a-topographic-map](https://clayb.net/blog/generating-a-topographic-map/)
